Ah! here it is."<strong> The wizard sorts through his pack and produces a blue vial that seems to be glowing.</strong> "Courageous adventurer, if you answer these questions I will give you this vial. Hmmmm yes. It shall grant thee knowledge of one of three languages. Only one! <em>Yesss.</em> A powerful language it is. <em>Very powerful.</em> However! If you fail to answer the questions you will meet your DOOOOOM!" <strong>The wizard places the vial in his sleeve and raises his staff.</strong> "You may begin!"</p>
